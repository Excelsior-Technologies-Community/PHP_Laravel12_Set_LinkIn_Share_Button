## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Laravel Project

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-linkedin-share
cd laravel-linkedin-share
```

Create a controller:

```bash
php artisan make:controller PostController
```

---

## Step 2: Set Up Routes

Edit `routes/web.php`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\PostController;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

Route::get('/posts', [PostController::class, 'index'])->name('posts.index');
Route::get('/posts/{id}', [PostController::class, 'show'])->name('posts.show');
```

---

## Step 3: Create Controller

File: `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`

The controller:

* Stores demo blog posts in arrays
* Displays all posts on the index page
* Displays a single post based on ID
* Handles invalid post IDs with 404 error

---

## Step 4: Create Views

### Posts List Page

Path:

```
resources/views/posts/index.blade.php
```

Responsibilities:

* Display list of blog posts
* Show title, short content, author
* Link to single post page

---

### Single Post Page

Path:

```
resources/views/posts/show.blade.php
```

Responsibilities:

* Display full post content
* Show author and publish date
* Display featured image
* Provide LinkedIn share buttons

LinkedIn Share Methods:

1. Simple URL share link
2. Official LinkedIn SDK share button
3. Custom JavaScript share popup

---

## Step 5: Update Welcome Page

Path:

```
resources/views/welcome.blade.php
```

Purpose:

* Acts as landing page
* Explains project purpose
* Provides navigation to demo blog
* Explains how LinkedIn sharing works

---

## Step 6: App Name Configuration (Optional)

Edit `config/app.php`:

```php
'name' => env('APP_NAME', 'Laravel Blog'),
```

This name is used when sharing content.

---

## Step 7: Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Application URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## How LinkedIn Sharing Works

### Method 1: Simple URL Sharing

* No JavaScript required

### Method 2: LinkedIn SDK
